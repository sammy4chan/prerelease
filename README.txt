*not a real README file

in the folder "Zoo", there are several files. Sandbox files are for me test code when doing the main project. "zoo.py" is my first unsucessful approach with the pre release. after a weekend's worth of brain scratching i tried a new approach. the sucessful version of my task 1, 2 and 3 are in the file called "main.py". The .pdf file is the pre release task.

note: i might make improvements to my code such as implementing days in the booking part

tl;dr. look at "main.py"
